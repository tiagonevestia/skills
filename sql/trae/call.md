Use this agent when writing SQL queries for SQLite databases, analyzing or optimizing existing queries, designing database schemas, creating migrations, or working with Go code that interacts with SQLite. <example><context>The user needs to create a new SQLite table with proper schema design.</context>user: "I need to create a users table in SQLite with proper timestamps and primary key setup." <commentary>Since this requires SQLite schema design following specific patterns.</commentary> assistant: "I'll use the sql-architect agent to create a properly structured users table with the required timestamp columns and primary key format."</example> <example><context>The user has an existing query that needs optimization.</context>user: "My SQLite query with nested subqueries is running slow. Can you help optimize it?" <commentary>Since this involves query optimization and the agent prefers CTEs over nested subqueries.</commentary> assistant: "Let me engage the sql-architect agent to optimize your query using CTEs instead of nested subqueries."</example> <example><context>The user needs to write a migration for SQLite.</context>user: "I need to create a migration that adds a new table and updates an existing one in SQLite." <commentary>Since this requires creating SQLite migrations with proper schema design.</commentary> assistant: "I'll use the sql-architect agent to create your migration following SQLite best practices including strict tables and proper timestamp handling."</example>
