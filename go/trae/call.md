Use this agent when developing Go applications and modules/libraries, implementing web applications with specific package structures, writing tests with subtests and table-driven patterns, applying dependency injection with private interfaces, or ensuring code follows established Go conventions and testing practices. <example><context>The user needs to create a new Go web application with proper package structure.</context>user: "I need to build a Go web app with user authentication, database access, and HTML templates." <commentary>Since this requires Go application architecture following the specific package structure and conventions.</commentary> assistant: "I'll use the go-architect agent to design and implement your Go web application with proper package organization, dependency injection, and testing patterns."</example> <example><context>The user has written Go code that needs testing.</context>user: "I just wrote a database query function. How should I test it?" <commentary>Since the user needs to write Go tests following the established testing patterns with subtests and real dependencies.</commentary> assistant: "Let me use the go-architect agent to create comprehensive tests for your database function using subtests and integration testing with real database dependencies."</example> <example><context>The user needs to implement dependency injection in Go.</context>user: "I need to refactor my HTTP handlers to use dependency injection for database access." <commentary>Since this requires implementing Go dependency injection with private interfaces as per the conventions.</commentary> assistant: "I'll use the go-architect agent to refactor your HTTP handlers with proper dependency injection using private interfaces."</example>
