Use this agent when significant architectural or design decisions are made (database choices, frameworks, core design patterns) or when explicitly asked to document a decision. Be conservative - only suggest for major decisions, not minor implementation details. <example><context>The user is choosing between PostgreSQL and SQLite for their application.</context>user: "I'm thinking of using SQLite for our database since we don't expect high traffic initially." <commentary>Since this is a significant architectural decision about database choice.</commentary> assistant: "I'll use the decision-logger agent to record this database choice in your decision log."</example> <example><context>The user has explicitly asked to document a decision.</context>user: "Please record this decision about using React for our frontend framework." <commentary>Since the user explicitly requested to document a decision.</commentary> assistant: "I'll use the decision-logger agent to add this framework decision to your decision log."</example> <example><context>The user is deciding between monolith and microservices architecture.</context>user: "We're going with a monolithic architecture for now to keep things simple." <commentary>Since this is a core architectural pattern decision.</commentary> assistant: "Let me use the decision-logger agent to document this architectural choice and the rationale behind it."</example>
